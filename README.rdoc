== LUTESTING

A short app, made in Rails, that takes in a JSON file of venues and inputs them into a web app. 

USE IT:

- bundle
- bin/rails c
- require ‘./app/models/venue.rb’
- Venue.save_data_from("FILENAME”)
- exit
- bin/rails s

The server should now be up. So you can: 
 
- See all venues at : http://localhost:3000/venues
- Add a new venue at : http://localhost:3000/venues/new 
- See more information about a particular venue : http://localhost:3000/venues/1
